## ✅ Three Steps to Success

### 1️⃣ Initialize Git (5 min)
Run `INITIALIZE_GIT.bat` and enter:
- Your GitHub username
- Your GitHub email

### 2️⃣ Create GitHub Repo (2 min)
- Go to: https://github.com/new
- Name: `SmartJobMatchZM`
- Description: `AI-Powered Job Matching Platform for Zambia`
- **Don't check any boxes!**
- Click "Create repository"

### 3️⃣ Connect & Push (3 min)
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SmartJobMatchZM.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

### If something goes wrong:
1. Check **[GIT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](GIT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**
2. Read the error message carefully
3. Google the specific error
4. Come back with the exact error message

### Common issues:
- "git is not recognized" → Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- "Permission denied" → Use HTTPS instead of SSH
- "Remote already exists" → Run `git remote remove origin` first

---

## ✨ After Setup

Once Git is working:
1. ✅ Run `git status` (should show clean working tree)
2. ✅ Visit your GitHub repo (all files should be there)
3. ✅ Tell me: **"Git setup complete! Ready for Phase 2."**

Then we'll start building your FastAPI backend! 🚀
