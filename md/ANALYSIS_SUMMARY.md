## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP

### **Priority #1: Create Brian Mwale's CV** (5 minutes)

**The Problem:**
Your test user Brian doesn't have a CV, so AI matching doesn't work for him.

**The Solution:**
I've created a seed script that will give Brian a complete, realistic CV with:
- 4.5 years of experience
- Software developer background
- Multiple technical and soft skills
- Work history at 3 companies
- Education from UNZA
- Professional projects and references

**How to Run:**

```bash
cd C:\Dev\ai-job-matchingV2\backend
python seed_brian_cv.py
```

**What Happens:**
1. Creates comprehensive CV for Brian
2. Links it to his user account
3. Enables AI matching for him
4. Allows full testing of the app

**After Running:**
1. Restart your backend
2. Login as Brian: brian.mwale@example.com / test123
3. You'll see AI-matched jobs! 🎉

## 📈 After Brian's CV is Seeded

**You'll Go From:** 78% → 82% complete

**Next Priority Tasks:**

### 2. Fix Job Details in Saved/Applications (45 min)
Currently showing placeholder data. Need to add database joins.

### 3. Implement File Upload (1-2 hrs)
Let users upload their resumes.

### 4. Add Employer Endpoints (2-3 hrs)
Complete the employer user flow.

### 5. Write Tests (3-4 hrs)
Start with critical paths, aim for 60% coverage.

**After These:** You'll be at ~92% MVP completion!
